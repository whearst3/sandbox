misc python experiments and notes.

I have been working on a simple ios "app" using pythonista -
but may end up targeting a dedicated device based on RaspberryPi.

Designing algorithms in Mathemtica desktop.
Converting to Pyhton 3.5
Upload into tested code to Pynthonista and deploy with simple UI on iPhone 6.

This device has GPS, and is small portable, with decent battery life

Goal is app to convert Lat Lon data of current position to
ATC phrase to describe location in radio english.

e.g : from GPS/LOLA  --> "2 nm NE of SGD vor"

So pilot can describ present position without using 
long winded, error probe, and difficult to interpret
Latitude/Longitude phrase

In Short, ATC understandable position vs geo-coordinates

App will use an internal database of position reference points
App will not require internet access, only GPS position.
