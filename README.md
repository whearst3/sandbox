Misc python experiments and notes.

I have been working on a simple iOS "app" using pythonista,
but may end up targeting a dedicated device based on RaspberryPi.

Designing the algorithms in Mathemtica desktop.
Converting them to Pyhton 3.5 then:
Upload tested code to Pynthonista, and deploy with iOS UI on iPhone 6.

This device has GPS, and is small portable, with decent battery life.
Able to stay charged with 12 volt DC auxillary outlet,  in an airplane.

Goal of app is to convert Lat/Lon data of current position from GPS 
To ATC phrase,  describing location in radio english.

e.g :  GPS/LOLA  --->  "2 nm NE of SGD vor"

So pilot can describ present position without using 
long winded, error probe, and difficult to interpret
Latitude/Longitude phrase

In Short, ATC understandable phrase from geo-coordinates

App will use an internal database of position reference points
App will not require internet access, only GPS position.
