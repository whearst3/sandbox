misc python experiments and notes.

I have been working on a simple ios "app" using pythonista -
but may end up targeting a dedicated device based on RaspberryPi.

Designing algorithms in Mathemtica desktop.
Converting to Pyhton 3.5
Upload into tested code to Pynthonista and deploy with simple UI on iPhone 6.

This device has GPS and is small portable, decent battery life
